	default_paragraph_class is just stuff for <p> accodring to http://www.w3schools.com/

	One day if I learn how to do good looking web design maybe I'll change this. Make it look unique and also give saner classnames.
	This is included in the hopes that it will make the code easier to use/modify for someone else in the future.
