# RedirectLogQ


## Purpose:

I needed a way to redirect URLs and log them. Instead of searching the internet for something that does it for me I've decided to make it myself.



## Dependencies:

* Python3: https://www.python.org/
* MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/

**These Python Modules**

* Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
* PyMongo: https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/
* pybase62: https://github.com/suminb/base62
* Requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

To resolve the python module dependencies you can ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
